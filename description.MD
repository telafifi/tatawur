## Notes for Implementation

This specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for building the Tatawur AI marketing website. The content emphasizes your unique position at the intersection of structural engineering and software leadership, while positioning the consulting services as practical, results-oriented solutions for AEC firms.

The site should convey evolution and transformation while maintaining credibility through your proven track record. The design should be modern enough to reflect cutting-edge technology capabilities but professional enough to appeal to traditional AEC industry decision-makers.

Focus on clear value propositions, easy navigation, and a frictionless path to contact/conversion.
